# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used

The following AI tools were used during the development of this assignment:

1. ChatGPT  
   Used for UI styling suggestions, responsive layout improvements, and JavaScript feature implementation guidance.

2. GitHub Copilot   
   Assisted with syntax correction, styling adjustments, color palette refinement, and code structure improvements inside the editor.

## Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits

Using AI tools significantly improved the overall design consistency and structure of the project. ChatGPT provided suggestions for organizing CSS using variables, improving layout blocks, and selecting a suitable purple-based color palette that matches a modern UI style.

The AI tools also helped in:
- Adjusting spacing, sizes, and layout alignment.
- Implementing responsive design using media queries.
- Creating interactive features such as Dark Mode and dynamic greeting messages.
- Implementing form interaction logic using JavaScript.

These suggestions helped ensure that the website works smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.

### Challenges

One of the main challenges was selecting an appropriate theme and color palette that looks professional and balanced. Some AI-generated styling suggestions required manual adjustments to better fit the project structure.

Additionally, AI suggestions sometimes needed refinement to ensure consistency with the existing HTML structure and academic requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

Through the use of AI tools, I learned:

- How to structure CSS using variables for better maintainability.
- How to implement responsive design effectively using media queries and Flexbox.
- How to integrate JavaScript features such as Dark Mode toggle and time-based greeting messages.
- How to handle form submission behavior using event listeners and prevent default form reloading.
- How to review AI-generated code critically and modify it to match project requirements.

This process improved both my technical skills and my understanding of how to responsibly use AI-assisted development tools.

## Responsible Use and Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed, tested, and modified when necessary. I ensured that I understood the logic behind each piece of code before integrating it into the project.

The final implementation reflects my own understanding and adjustments rather than unmodified AI output. AI tools were used as assistants to support learning and development, not as replacements for independent work.
